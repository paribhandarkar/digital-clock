# Digital Clock

I created a functional and visually appealing clock using web development technologies.

Using HTML, I created the structure and content of the clock. Then, with CSS, I was able to style the clock's appearance to make it look attractive and appealing. Finally, with the help of JS, I added functionality to the clock by using built-in date and time functions to display the current time.

My digital clock project, which is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, is what I think best exemplifies the power of web programming. Knowing that I can produce something that others may view and use online is a wonderful feeling.

## Demo

You can try out the application by visiting [this link](https://paribhandarkar.github.io/digital-clock/).

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## New Things I Learned

I learned about the setInterval() function and how to actually implement it.

I also learned about Date(), which I had never used before.

## Challenges I faced

I overlooked the fact that when the time is a single digit number, we must display a zero in front of it. This wasn't particularly difficult, but it made me more aware of the small details.
